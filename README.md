# Real-time-color-recognition-and-material-segregation

I developed an innovative real-time color detection and material identification system using OpenCV, aimed at recognizing colors and identifying specific materials through live video feed analysis. This application leverages computer vision techniques to provide immediate feedback on the color and material of objects, which can be useful in various industrial and quality control applications.

- Real-Time Color Detection: The system captures live video from a camera and allows users to click on any point in the frame to detect the color of the selected pixel.
- Material Identification: The application includes logic to detect specific materials such as Mild Steel, Copper, and Brass based on their unique RGB color ranges.
- User Interaction: Users can interact with the system by clicking on any point in the video feed to obtain detailed color and material information.

-Color Matching Algorithm: The closest color name is determined by calculating the minimum distance between the RGB values of the clicked pixel and the dataset entries.
- Material Identification Logic: Specific RGB ranges are defined to identify materials such as Mild Steel, Copper, and Brass, providing immediate material recognition.I developed an innovative real-time color detection and material identification system using OpenCV, aimed at recognizing colors and identifying specific materials through live video feed analysis.
